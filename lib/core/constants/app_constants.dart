I am an aspiring Software Developer who thrives on bridging gaps between different disciplines, teams, and industries. With a strong technical background in computer engineering, my primary interests lie in Android and Flutter Development, although I am open to exploring other Software Development roles as well.

My proficiency extends to a diverse range of programming languages, including Python, C++, C#, Kotlin, SQL, Android, MySQL, JAVA, C, Flutter, Dart, and Git. This broad skill set equips me to handle various technical challenges effectively. Additionally, I have familiarity with languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP.

If you have any potential opportunities or would like to discuss collaborations, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email at yashashm.dev@gmail.com.

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I held several leadership positions. As the President of the college student committee, I developed strong organizational and communication skills. Furthermore, I served as a Project Head during internships, where I honed my project management abilities while leading teams. Additionally, I have participated in national hackathons, taking charge of teams and contributing to innovative solutions.

Beyond my technical skills, I have a deep passion for music. As a hobby, I am proficient in playing the guitar, singing, and writing and composing songs. To date, I have created over 33 compositions, showcasing my creativity and dedication.

I am eager to apply my technical expertise, leadership experience, and passion for music to contribute effectively to software development projects. I look forward to exploring opportunities where I can utilize my skills and make a meaningful impact.
